I don’t mean to quote from ‘Schoolhouse Rock,’ but ‘Knowledge IS power!’ However, I do believe you are taking the right steps anyway! Ovarian cancer is nothing to mess around with and it sounds like it’s just rampant in your family. I am BRCA1 positive and was diagnosed with breast cancer in April. I’ll be getting a preventative hysterectomy later this year as well and I have the same fears as you do: that I’ll end up being some sweaty, angry, crazy person that my son doesn’t want to be around. But from what I have read, while there is an adjustment period, it does get better and they may be able to put you on some low-dose hormone therapy for a little while if necessary to get you over the worst of it.","Maureen – FORCE forum, in 146 Dead metaphors and responsibilised bodies-in-transition: the implications of medical metaphors for understanding the consumption of preventative healthcare"

CELLS_ARE_ROUND_LEGOS,,,,"There are many types of cells. Red blood cells, immune cells, liver cells and thousand more. In a complex organism they fit together as a somewhat harmonious whole. You see the same type of structural harmony with assembled Legos. There are many shapes and sizes of Lego and several colors.  They can be put together to make some thing that makes sense, a house, a plane or just about anything else. The linked LegoMan is a good approximation. Of course if there were round Legos, it would be an even better approximation.",Metamia
CELLULASE_IS_A_MOLECULAR_CHAIN_SAW,,,,"cellulase is an enzyme that breaks down cellulose. It does this by breaking the bonds between the glucose monomers that constitute this naturally occurring polymer. In practice is usually a  mixture of several molecules acting together. To mix this metaphor, it could be a """"wolf pack"""" of enzymes.",Metamia
FUEL_CELL_IS_A_WINDMILL,,,,"Energy Conversion is what it's all about. These 2 things convert energy from one from to another. Windmills convert wind energy to mechanical energy. Fuel cells convert potential chemical energy stored in hydrogen(or methanol or methane) and oxygen into actual electrical energy. For a windmill to produce mechanical energy the wind needs to keep flowing, for a fuel cell to produce electricity, it needs the hydrogen and oxygen to keep flowing through it system.",Metamia
HOST_CELL_IS_A_HOUSE_WITH_DIFFERENT_TYPES_OF_GUEST,,,,Some guests are polite and work with the host house to keep the house in order and running well (Mutualism). Some guest come in have a wild party reproduce like crazy and then break the walls down on the way out (HIV). There are many types of houses and many types of guest as indicated by the linked wiki article.,Metamia
CELL_CYCLE_IS_A_RODEO,,,,"I taught a lesson dreamed up by my mentor teacher Thursday in which the kids act out the process of cell division as a """"rodeo."""" Imagine centriole cowboys lassoing a herd of chromatids and you have a sense of how it worked.",Metamia
CANCER_CELL_IS_A_HUMAN_FACE,,,,"Human faces have tremendous variability.  This variability is genetic variability. As everyone knows, some people have blue eyes, white skin and square cheeks. The same genetic dynamic occurs with cancer cells, which are a part of the human body controlled by the genetic composition of that person.  One of the reasons that cancer drugs work so poorly is that they don't account for the genetic profile  of the individual patient. In a fashion, drug development consists of """"training"""" molecules recognize cancer cell. Because of variability between the cell line used to develop the drug and the cancers cells in the patients,  the drugs have a tendency, not recognize the cancer and get lost in the body.",Metamia
CELL_BIOLOGY_IS_A_ROCK_CONCERT,,,,"Imagine a crowded rock concert. You are directly in front of the stage, but your cute date is stuck behind an enormous mass of moving people. As your date pushes and squeezes through the crowd, you worry about other attractive fans stealing your date's attention. Will your date make it through all those packed people? Believe it or not, this is an important question in cellular biology!",Metamia
CELL_SURFACE_IS_COBBLESTONE,,,,"Typically cell membranes have proteins mixed within their cell membranes, therefore a cell surface will be more bumpy than smooth, a cobblestone if you will.",Metamia
CELL_MEMBRANE_IS_A_GATED_FENCE_AROUND_A_FACTORY,,,,"This is a site for teaching simple concepts to younger children. This was one of the more """"accurate"""" analogies that was floating around the web. In encompasses the dual nature of biological membranes found in most cells. They have a fence like quality for  controlling water flow and thus giving structure to acell. But they also have a gate like structure for allow certain molecules to pass in and out in a very controlled way.",Metamia
MAMMALIAN_CELL_IS_A_FOOTBALL_STADIUM_ON_SUNDAY_GAME_DAY,,,,"The mammalian cell is taught and explained in many K-12 classes as well as in college. From my vantage point they are explained with 10-20 essential parts. This simplification is necessary in the learning process to prime students' minds about the subject. But this framework misses something. Mammalian cells, as they occur in real life, are extremely complicated dynamic entities. To get a feel for actually may be occurring, a stadium metaphor may be helpful. Visualize a football stadium on game day; it is a huge structure with ten of thousands of people coming and going some sitting, some moving. Some the activity is highly structured, the game itself and the fans sitting in the seats. Some of the activity is unstructured. Penalties in the game and fans getting drunk and starting fights.  The key point is that there are thousand of movements within the confined and structured space of the stadium. This crudely approximates the dynamic physiology of a mammalian cell.",Metamia
RED_BLOOD_CELLS_ARE_OXYGEN_BARGES,,,,"They move oxygen around the body the way barges moves stuff up and down the Mississippi river. Of course the red blood cells  can only carry 4 oxygen molecules/hemoglobin molecule. But there are  many of these little boats, about 45% of the blood, so the system works pretty well.",Metamia
EPENDYMAL_CELLS_ARE_A_CUSHION_AND_FILTER,,,,Cerebrospinal fluid produced by ependymal cells provides both mechanical protection - padding - and a means to remove metabolic waste products.,Metamia
CELLS_OF_SYSTEMS_BIOLOGY_ARE_A_REALITY_SHOW_ON_TV,,,,"Although we can sometimes mistake a TV show for a true representation of human behavior, we generally agree there is much more to life than what we see on Temptation Island or Big Brother. Systems biology can only work if we relate back to the cell, organism, or ecosystem. It is the behavior of our models that is complex, not necessarily the behavior of the cell.",Metamia
MENTAL_ILLNESS_IS_BEING_A_TODDLER,,,,"Toddlers have almost no control of what they feel and how they react. Sometimes, I notice myself reacting and in my head, I know it's irrational or due to an anxiety symptom, but I literally don't know how else to cope besides lashing out.",Metamia
GOOD_MEDICINE_IS_A_GOOD_APPROXIMATION_IN_MATHEMATICS,,,,"As long as the part which one tolerates [that is, the margin of error] is small, the solution is quite correct and the person arriving at it is quite skilled. Therefore, artful conjecturing in medicine is similar"""". 'Abd al-Latif even goes so far as to describe medicine as 'the knowledge of probabilities (al-ma'rifa al-akthariya)'.",Metamia
